# Parasite detection and localization
This is the BA$ dissertation in Ghent university.

# Abstract
The goal of this project is the correct classification using Convolutional Neural Network and weakly-supervised localization using visualization. VGG-16 Architecture is used as CNN architecture and Gradient-weighted Class Activation Map (Grad-CAM) for visualization. The data for this project is the microscopy images of thick blood smears that were extracted from Trypanosoma parasites infected and non-infected mice. Hence, the positive samples are images containing parasites and the negative samples are images not-containing parasites.
